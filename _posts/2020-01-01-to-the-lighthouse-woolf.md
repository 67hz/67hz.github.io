First of all, this is the first Virginia Woolf I have read. On one hand, I am bummed having gone through life until now without her insight, but as Randy Travis would say - ***on the other hand***. I have so much Woolf to consume. 

This book is just fantastic. Her style is unlike anything I have encountered. The reader is bounced from one character's thoughts to anothers. Some of the "On Writing" style books will tell you not to use voice-over or inner dialogue, but here it is essential. I am always impressed by writers who create full characters that can prop the story up on their own. Fill a book with even just one of those and you are golden. Steinbeck does it with dozens, but that's another story - literally. Here, Woolf weaves deep imagery from within the character's minds. She takes a blank canvas at the onset and builds brush stroke after brush stroke layering a deep and connectable image. By the second act, the reader is intimately familiar with a handful of characters from the inside looking out. This painting motif spans the whole of the novel as we see Lily Briscoe struggling to paint - to paint life itself. Painting is, after all, one's interpretation of objects.

>...she took her hand and raised her brush. For a moment it stayed trembling in a painful but exciting ecstacy in the air. Where to begin?--that was the question at what point to make the first mark? One line placed on the canvas committed her to innumerable risks, to frequent and irrevocable decisions. All that in idea seemed simple became in practice immediately complex; as the waves shape themselves symmetrically from the cliff top, but to the swimmer among them are divided by steep gulfs, and foaming crests. Still the risk must run; the mark made.


Woolf can be lachrymose, no doubt. But where she induces sadness, she lifts the veil on the human pysche in a way that is competely her own, yet universal. There is a rhythm to this book. This is probably a Woolf thing. It may take some readers a while to settle into the pace. I certainly did. It is easy to lose track on whose thoughts you may or may not be following. Like a 5/8 jazz groove*, once you find it, it feels right. Until you do, things are uneasy as you stumble to find cadence on the down beat.

> About here, she thought, dabbling her fingers in the water, a ship had sunk, and she muttered, dreamily half asleep, how we perished, each alone.

There are so many passages in this book that left me stunned. How Woolf is able to dish out many a lifetime worth of epiphanies and poignant lamentations is beyond reality. Reading, I mark passages that make me rethink the heavy stuff: life, love, quotidian banalities. I stopped marking a third of the way in. The heavy stuff is too numerous to keep track of. Focus is key while reading this because every line contains a potential shotgun blast to the heart.

> All the being and the doing, expansive, glittering, vocal, evaporated; and one shrunk, with a sense of solemnity, to being oneself, a wedge-shaped core of darkness, something invisible to others.


When people tell me they only read non-fiction because they prefer to learn things when they read, I immediately file them in the disposable characters category. Woolf is a great answer to such misinformed erudites. Read this. Learn about life. If you finish it without laughing out loud or crying yourself to sleep, you have an operating system that needs updating - you ain't human. Spend a weekend with this one. Stick with it. Find Virginia's pace and let her pull back the curtain for you.


> Yes, she thought, laying down her brush in extreme fatigues, I have had my vision.

* 5/8 is a musical form with 5 eighth-notes per measure. Traditional western music has 4 quarter-notes per measure or 8 eighth-notes. The waltz is the exception with 3 quarter notes. Listen to **Take 5** by ***Bill Evans*** to hear 5/8. Try counting 1-2-3-4-5 in rhythm. Next, listen to something like **Johnny B. Goode** by ***Chuck Berry*** in 4/4 and count 1-2-3-4. Now go buy a pack of smokes and a pork-pie hat. You are a bonafide, gin-soacked jazzer with rockabilly stylings.
