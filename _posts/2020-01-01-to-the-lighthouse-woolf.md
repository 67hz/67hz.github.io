First of all, this is the first Virginia Woolf I have read. On one hand, I am bummed out having gone through life up until now without her insight, but as Randy Travis would say - ***on the other hand***. I have so much Woolf to consume. 

This book is just fantastic. Her style is unlike anything I have encountered. The reader is bounced from one character's thoughts to anothers. Some of the "On Writing" style books will tell you not to use voice-over or inner dialogue, but here it is essential. I have always been impressed by writers who can create full characters  who prop the story up on their own. Fill a book with even just one of those and you are golden. Steinbeck does it with dozens, but that's another story, literally.

Woolf can be lachrymose, no doubt. But where she induces sadness, she lifts the veil on the human pysche in a way that is competely her own, yet universal. There is a rhythm to this book. This is probably a Woolf thing. It may take some readers a while to settle into the pace. I certainly did. It is easy to lose track on whose thoughts you may or may not be following. Like a 5/8 jazz groove*, once you find it, it feels right. Until you do, things are uneasy as you stumble to find cadence on the down beat.

There are so many passages in this book that left me stunned. How Woolf is able to dish out many a lifetime worth of epiphanies and poignant lamentations is beyond reality. I usually mark passages that floor me. I stopped doing that a third of the way in. They are too numerous to keep track of. When people tell me they only read non-fiction because they prefer to learn things when they read, I immediately file them in the dismissal category. Woolf is a great answer to such misinformed erudites. Read this. Learn about life. If you finish it without laughing out loud or crying yourself to sleep, you have an operating system that needs updating - you ain't human. Spend a weekend with this one. Stick with it. Find Virginia's pace and let her pull back the curtain for you.

* 5/8 is a musical form with 5 eighth-notes per measure. Traditional western music has 4 quarter-notes per measure or 8 eighth-notes. The waltz is the exception with 3 quarter notes. Listen to **Take 5** by ***Bill Evans*** to hear 5/8. Try counting 1-2-3-4-5 in rhythm. Next, listen to something like **Johnny B. Goode** by ***Chuck Berry*** in 4/4 and count 1-2-3-4. Now go buy a pack of smokes and a pork-pie hat. You are a bonafide, gin-soacked jazzer with rockabilly stylings.
