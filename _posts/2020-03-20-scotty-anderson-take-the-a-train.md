title: Scotty Anderson is an unreal jazz guitarist

Scotty is one of my all-time favorite chicken pickers. It amazes me he never garnered the same
notoriety as guys like Albert Lee. He is known for his country twang, but in this clip he absolutely
dominates Duke Ellington's ***"Take the A Train"***.

His chord vocabulary is extensive. I think the most impressive parts are the octave runs Ã  la Wes Montgomery. He blazes through these runs faster than most accomplished pickers could pick single note phrases. I don't know if I am more blown away or depressed by watching this.

I need a faster metronome.
