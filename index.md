**Cryptography in C/C++**


After using libraries like [Libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc) for most of my hashing and encryption needs, trusting the API and moving on to the next task, I thought it was about time to peek under the covers and get aquainted with some industry-standard algos. 

The book opens with a breakdown of number theory in C. This is a good crash course in arithmetic and number theory in its own right. Moving on to the actual breakdown analysis of functions and algorithms happens seamlessly about 200 pages in. It's a dense read, but worth it.


Plus, any book that opens with a quote such as below is bound to be good, right?

> If you look at zero you see nothing; but look through it and you will see the world.

> Robert Kaplan, The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero
